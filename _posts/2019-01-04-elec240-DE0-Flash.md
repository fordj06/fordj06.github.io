# Configuring the DE0-Nano Flash Device

The DE0-Nano uses SRAM to store the configuration data it requires to operate. Since SRAM is volitile memory it will need to be re-written after every power cycle. The DE0-Nano has a flash device called the EPCS64. It has a capacity of 64Mb and will store the program configuration indefinitely. 

**EPCS64 Configuration steps:**

1. Generate the .sof file by compiling your program in the normal way. 
   
2. Goto File then Convert Programming Files

3. Under **Output programming file**, select **JTAG indirect configuration file** as the programming file type

4. Select **EPCS64** as the configuration device

5. Give the output file a name and path. The defult will work but I would recommend putting the output file in the output files folder of your project folder.

6. Under **Input files to convert** click on **Flash loader**. Then click on **Add device** button at the right side of the window. Select **EP4CE22** under **Cyclone IV E** and click **Ok**.

7. Under **Input files to convert** click on **SOF data**. Then click on **Add file** button at the right side of the window. Select you generated **.sof** file which is generally it is located in the *output_files* folder.

8. You can now generate the file by clicking **Generate**

Now you need to program the device with this file. To do this ensure that the DE0-Nano is connected. 

9. Under **Tools** > **Programmer**. This will open a new window. 
10. Clear any already added files by selecting them and clicking on the *Delete* button. 
11. Click on **Add file**
12. Select the **.jic** file that you created

13. Click on the check box under **Program / Configure**.

14. Click **Start**

15. Finally, cycle the board power. The DE0-Nano should now be successfully configured and you can see that when you power up the device you no longer see the default program but you see your program in it.
